AC Transit offers an open API with arrival prediction times and delay updates. There are many apps that use this API to see real time arrival predictions. A field returned by an API call returns how many seconds the bus is delayed before its arrival at the next stop. This backend service periodically polls the API to collect and average these delays. The map on the website then queries the database for the most recent delay for each line and colors each bus route according to its average delay.
